It can be hard to understand how the server works and how people started on their own. Hopefully, this will help!{LINE}{LINE}Getting started:&r{LINE}The kit you receive with /vote will help you substantially. Once you have these items, you're all set to get started! Mining will be how you first make any money. Many players do not recognize this instantly, but you are receiving much more money mining than you think! Just do /transferxp (Amount) to get the money from xp. 1 XP = 1000$!{LINE}{LINE}Getting upgrades:&r{LINE}Upgrades will be difficult at first. It is worth your time to figure out the maze - you will receive an atlas gem for completion. This is a great place to build off of.{LINE}{LINE}Understanding the auction house:&r{LINE}The auction house always has different items for sale. It is a new player's best friend – people are always selling tools, weapons, armor, and other helpful items. Once you have some money, check out what people have to offer!{LINE}{LINE}Using custom enchants and tokens:&r{LINE}There are many different custom enchants you can receive with books and keys. You can look at what each enchant does with /ceinfo. You can upgrade these enchants with tokens, which you will receive as you mine with upgraded tools. It takes a long time to learn each custom enchant - if you have questions, asking staff is always an option, too!{LINE}{LINE}Using spawners / headhunting:&r{LINE}Once you have many, spawners can be the most lucrative form of money making on the server. Spawners are hard to obtain, as they are expensive. Headhunting is leveled up by killing mobs on the lower tier spawners. Once leveled up, you can start to buy better spawners. The top spawners give more money than any other method on the server.{LINE}{LINE}Prestiging:&r{LINE}Prestiging grants you the highly coveted tokenmaster enchant at level 1. As you go further in the prestiges, you will get better and better rewards only received through prestiging. Only the best of the best players prestige - become the best of the best!"
